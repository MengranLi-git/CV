research,,2021,present,Research on Extreme Values of Streamflow in the U.S.A,"Glasgow, UK",,,<span class='work-subtitle'></span>,,"Summary statistics and kernel smoothing were applied to extract meaningful information from the data, detect patterns, etc. The features of streamflow were presented via hydrologic maps. The marginal models were fitted to identify the trends via stationary and non-stationary techniques and selected based on the AIC and the likelihood ratio was employed to test the significance. Return levels were calculated and plotted and bootstrapping evaluated the uncertainty. For the joint-fitting, estimations of the extremal coefficients based on Euclidean and hydrological distances in various approaches, such as madogram and bivariate Husler-Reiss distribution, were applied to check the asymptotic dependence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

research,,2018,,American Mathematical Modelling Contest,,,,<span class='work-subtitle'>Modeller</span>,How American states perform on clean energy:,The generalized linear models (GLMs) helped to better characterize how the energy profile of the states. The analytic hierarchy process model was applied to measure the importance among different states through MATLAB.,Prediction of energy profile of each state:,The same variables from the GLMs were inherited to construct the vector auto regression model. And E-views generated the prediction of energy profile of each state. Finally won the second prize.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
