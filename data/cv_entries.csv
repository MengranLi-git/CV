R packages data.table and tidyverse were used for data wrangling.",Non-stationary GEV models:,The nsGEV model was applied to identify the trends of hydrological extremes and estimate the resolution of return levels in the U.S.A. The uncertainty assessment was determined via bootstrapping. They were realized through R programming.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model was applied to measure the importance among different states through MATLAB.,Prediction of energy profile of each state:,The same variables from the GLM model were inherited to construct the vector auto regression (VAR) model. And E-views generated the prediction of energy profile of each state. Finally won the second prize.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
